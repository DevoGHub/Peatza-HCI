        This project helps us to order pizzas online through this system. Unlike other pizza ordering systems where we can choose our toppings and choose pizza, this system will be different. It will display a code for each pizza, which should be noted down by the customer for ordering through the form. When the administrator receives the code he will be able to deliver the pizza to the customer’s address. The pizza ordering has been made very interactive. We have used HTML, CSS, Jquery, Bootstrap, PHP, Javascript for implementing this system. 2. INTRODUCTION This pizza ordering system helps customers to order pizza online instead of coming to the shop. This system helps customers to sign up/login into the website for ordering their food. By logging in the system, the administrator would be able to get information about the customer. The customer can choose through the 20 varieties of pizza available in the system. He will also be able to send feedbacks to the administrator in case if there is anything to tell to the management about their experience. Customers need not to pay the amount through online. Cash on Delivery is the only option available in this system. The system is designed like this because customers might not want to share their credit card info via online. The main goal of this system is to provide customer satisfaction and provide a user-friendly interface to the user.<br><br>
